# Builder Services #

This is a list of services I've used and will be happy to use again. It's sort of a list for me to refer to but also help others you happen to live in the same area and stumble across this.

More people should give their recommendation because, to be completely honest, Google's results are a hot mess of SEO battles. Even by their own standards sites which meet certain criteria (mobile friendly, SSL) and have great reviews on Google get knocked down by companies using copy pasta page spam, setting up multiple business locations to increase the number of results, etc. Their results for something like these services is no better than 1995 alta vista.

Lives in Ely and serves the Cambridgeshire area. Very good work, honest and let's you know when what you want is probably not a great idea and gives good alternatives. Very good post-work clean up. This is one thing so many other builers cut corners on.

I believe, from the Ely area but again serves Cambridgeshire. Of all the electricians I've contact they were the most responsive. Didn't just ghost me because they've got too much work. The work was A++, quote up front, quality safety checks and honest. I asked to have a plug fixed and rather than just saying they fixed it they pointed out it's not really broke but was install in a half baked manner.
